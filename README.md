# Fake-news-detector-Spanish-News-Edition

The aim of this project is to build a fake news detector for Spanish news. 

ðŸ“ˆ Data: For this project we will use three datasets from Kaggle that you can find in the following link [Spanish fake news](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arseniitretiakov/noticias-falsas-en-espaol?select=onlytrue1000.csv). Both datasets: 'onlytrue1000' and 'onlyfakes1000' have 1000 rows and one column each. We will use the dataset 'test.csv' to test our model.

The target feautere will be 'fake_news_class'. This feature will have two values:
<ul>
  <li>0 = Real news</li>
  <li>1 = Fake news</li>
  
</ul>

ðŸ”¬ Methodology: Python is the primary tool for the data analysis and visualization. Morever, Github shall be used for Project management.
